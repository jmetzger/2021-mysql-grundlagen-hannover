SELECT * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='people' AND TABLE_SCHEMA='training' \G
```

### Show indexes 

```
SHOW INDEX FROM actor 
SHOW INDEXES FROM ACTOR 
```

### Change table (Add field)  

```
--- We want to add a field before name 
--- IMPORTANT: BEFORE does not exist 
ALTER TABLE people ADD first_name VARCHAR(10) AFTER id;
```

### Modify a field in table (Change property) 

```
ALTER TABLE people
	MODIFY COLUMN first_name VARCHAR(20);
```

### Drop a field from the table 

```
ALTER TABLE people ADD middle_name VARCHAR(25) BEFORE name; 
DESCRIBE people;
ALTER TABLE people DROP COLUMN middle_name;
```  

### Deleting table data (truncate) 

```
USE sakila
-- Create table based on other table 
CREATE TABLE actorcopy as SELECT * FROM actor;
-- Fields ? 
SELECT * FROM actorcopy; 
-- Empty it 
TRUNCATE TABLE actorcopy; 
-- Emptry ?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actorcopy; 
```

### Delete table data (with delete) 

#### Explanation 

  * Do not use delete when you want to use data of complete table
    * truncate is quicker in this case.
  * DELETE FROM ... WHERE ... does a SELECT first 
  
#### Example 

```
USE sakila
CREATE TABLE actorbackup AS SELECT * FROM actor;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actorbackup; 
DELETE FROM actorbackup WHERE actor_id > 100; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actorbackup; 
```

### Delete complete table 

```
USE sakila
DROP TABLE actorbackup;
```
